# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for AoC 2019 in Rust. This is my second year making a serious attempt at completing the challenges.

Notable days:

- Day 10: I really enjoyed this puzzle, even though the solution I came up with isn't optimal (I forgot about trig...)
- Day 12: First time actually competing in real time. Scored 403rd overall
- Day 13: I scored 75th on the first half the solution, but spent too long trying to figure out how move the paddle for part 2 and only got , when it ended up not being necessary. My grid-printing code from day 11 came in handy again
